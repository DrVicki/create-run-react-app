# create-run-react-app
Quick tutorial to create and run a React App in VS Code

### Change  directory to desktop

```
cd desktop
```


### Create React App on Desktop
```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Now we wait and let the magic happen.

  - Create React App is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React. 
  - It sets up your development environment so you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.

If the above command ran properly you can skip this step. However, if you got an error as shown below in the picture, the solution is to simply restart VS Code ( as this could be the result of installing Node.js while having VS Code open).

The above step automatically created the template required for react in the my-app folder.
  - Got to file-open folder-my-app at top left of VS Code Screen

### Now go ahead and write some code in app.js (my-app/src/app.js).
  - open the ```app.js``` file
  
  -Replace ```Learn React``` with 
  ```
  I am learning Software Development at Learning Source!
  ```
  
  
### Run your React App

Now, write the below command to finally run your code:

```
npm start
```

## Congratulations!! You created a React App.
